<h10>o I lived all alone, without anyone I could really talk to, until I had to make a crash landing in the Sahara Desert six years ago. Something in my plane's engine had broken. Since I had neither a mechanic nor passengers in the plane with me,
    <br>
 I was preparing to undertake the difficult repair job by myself. For me it was a matter of life or death: I had only enough drinking water for eight days.</h10>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>"If you please-drow me a sheep!!"</i>
<br>
<br>
<i>"What!!?"</i>
<br>
<br>
<I>"Draw me a sheep!"</I>
<br>
<br>
<h10>I leaped up as if I had been struck by lightning. I rubbed my eyes hard. I stared. And I saw an extraordinary little fellow staring back at me very seriously. Here is the best portrait I managed to make of him, later on.

</h10>
<img src="./photo_2023-04-24_12-49-58.jpg" alt="" width="400">
<h10>So I stared wide-eyed at this apparition. Don't forget that I was a thousand miles from any inhabited territory. Yet this little fellow seemed to be neither lost nor dying of exhaustion, hunger, or thirst; nor did he seem scared to death.There was nothing in his appearance that suggested a child lost in the middle of the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited territory.</h10>
<br>
<br>
<h10>When I finally managed to speak, I asked him, "But... what are you doing here? " And then he repeated, very slowly and very seriously, "Please... draw me a sheep..." When you encounter an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey. Absurd as it seemed, a thousand miles from all inhabited regions and in danger of death, I took a</h10>
<br>
<br>
<i>But what are u doing!?</i>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<I>If you please draw me a sheep!?</I>
<br>
<br>
<h10>No! No! I don't want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is very dangerous, and an elephant would get in the way. Where I live, everything is very small. I need a sheep. Draw me a sheep." So then I made a drawing. He looked at it carefully, and then said, "No. This one is already quite sick. Make another. " I made another drawing. My friend gave me a kind, indulgent smile:
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>That doesn't matter,Draw me a sheep!!?</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h10>This one's too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time. " So then, impatiently, since I was in a hurry to start work on my engine, I scribbled this drawing, and added, "This is just the crate. The sheep you want is inside. " But I was amazed to see my young critic's face light up. "That's just the kind I wanted! Do you think this sheep will need a lot of grass? " "Why? " "Because where I live, everything is very small..." "There's sure to be enough. I've given you a very small sheep. " He bent over the drawing. "Not so small as all that..." Look!</h10>

    "You can see for yourself... that's not a sheep, it's a ram. It has</h10>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h10>he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money
        does his father make?" Only from these figures do they think they have learned
        anything about him.
        If you were to say to the grown−ups: "I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick,
        with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof," they would not be able to
        get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: "I saw a house
        that cost $20,000." Then they would exclaim: "Oh, what a pretty house that is!"</h10>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h10>Just so, you might say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed is that he
            was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody
            wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists." And what good would it do to tell
            them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you
            said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B−612," then they would be
            convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.
            They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always
            show great forbearance toward grown−up people.
            But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I
            should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy−tales. I should
            have like to say: "Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet
            that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep..."
            To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to
            my story.
            For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much
            grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my
            friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to
            make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has
            had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown−ups who are no
            longer interested in anything but figures</h10>

                <h10>It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It
                    is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures
                    except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from
                    the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life
                    as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right,
                    and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the littl e
                    prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some
                    doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good,
                    now bad, and I hope generally fair−to−middling.
                    In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something
                    that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought,
                    perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through
                    t he walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown−ups. I have had to grow</h10>
